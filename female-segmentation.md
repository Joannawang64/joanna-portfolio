# Female Customer Segmentation for Credit Card Campaigns

## 📍 Background
The female segment of our credit card user base showed declining campaign response and limited engagement with card benefits. In response, I initiated and co-scoped an analysis in collaboration with product and marketing stakeholders to better understand sub-group behaviors and uncover opportunities for more tailored, value-driven strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Uncover key transactional and behavioral differences within the female customer segment through cross-functional investigation 
- Identify high-value subsegments for targeted engagement and personalized benefit design  
- Support downstream teams in increasing campaign conversion and long-term customer activation through actionable segmentation outputs

## 🛠 Tools Used
SQL, SAS, Excel(Pivot Table), PowerPoint

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Collaborated with the product team to assess existing benefit schemes and identified a lack of differentiation across female customer groups, which inspired the segmentation initiative.
2. **Data Preparation**: Scoped, extracted, and transformed over 20 million customer records from transactional and behavioral databases using SQL and SAS to support the analysis framework.
3. **Customer Profiling**: Analyzed collaboratively defined customer dimensions, including transaction behavior, asset level, account activity rate, spending categories, city tier, and age, to construct a comprehensive behavioral portrait of female customers.
4. **Segmentation Logic**: Partnered with a fellow data analyst to conduct TGI correlation analysis, identifying age and city tier as high-impact segmentation drivers. Led the development of composite indicators and rule-based grouping logic.
5. **Segment Validation**: Co-led the validation process by cross-analyzing segment behaviors across spending preferences, benefit needs, and activity levels. Aligned findings across analytics and product stakeholders to ensure business interpretability and adoption.
6. **Visualization**: Delivered dashboards iteratively in PowerPoint, incorporating stakeholder feedback to enhance clarity and decision relevance. Visuals enabled effective communication of segment-specific insights and potential strategy pivots.
7. **Insight Generation & Business Handoff**: Drove benefit alignment workshops with product and marketing teams to transform analytical findings into tailored value propositions and audience-specific campaign initiatives. Acted as a communication bridge between data, product, and marketing layers.

## ✅ Impact

## 💬 My Role
Independently led the full-cycle analysis from hypothesis to insight delivery, collaborating with the marketing and product teams. I ensured the findings were not only shared, but translated into actionable strategies by actively contributing to benefit redesign discussions.
