# 📊 Complaint Root Cause Analysis

## 📍 Background
Our customer service team observed a rising trend in complaint volumes over recent months, with inconsistent resolution outcomes and limited visibility into underlying causes. I initiated a root cause analysis project in collaboration with compliance, customer care, and data science teams to uncover systemic pain points and support product and experience improvements.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key themes and root causes within customer complaints
- Quantify impact by issue type, product line, and customer value segment
- Recommend targeted fixes to reduce complaint volumes and improve satisfaction

## 🛠 Tools Used
SQL, SAS, in-house LLM (Large Language Model), Excel, PowerPoint

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Problem Scoping**: Worked with customer care and compliance teams to define key analysis questions, prioritize complaint categories, and determine reporting needs.
2. **Data Preparation**: Extracted and cleaned ~220,000 complaint records from internal systems, ensuring completeness and standardizing free-text fields for analysis.
3. **Text Mining**: Partnered with a data scientist to apply our in-house large language model (LLM) tools for complaint text segmentation and topic extraction. I provided initial labeling guidance and evaluated clustering outputs for business relevance, enabling the transformation of unstructured customer feedback into structured, actionable themes.
4. **Root Cause Clustering**: Grouped recurring complaint topics into 10+ core issue themes (e.g., rewards redemption misunderstanding, billing errors, card benefit delays) using a mix of LLM output and manual tagging.
5. **Quantitative Analysis**: Mapped complaints to transaction type, card product, and customer value tier. Identified issue concentrations in high-value customer segments, especially around redemption timing and unclear eligibility rules.
6. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Created slide decks and visualizations to present findings in cross-functional meetings. Facilitated feedback sessions with product and operations to prioritize feasible fixes.
7. **Recommendation Design**: Proposed both tactical improvements (e.g., more visible in-app reminders) and strategic process changes (e.g., redesign of eligibility rules and UI copy), which were handed off with owner assignments and timelines.

## ✅ Impact
- Delivered 4 actionable recommendations, 3 of which were implemented within 2 months
- Complaints related to target issues dropped by 10% in the following quarter
- Framework reused in two other departments for similar root cause analysis efforts

## 💬 My Role
Led the project from scoping to delivery, aligning stakeholders across analytics, compliance, customer care, and product. I acted as the analysis owner, business translator, and presenter—bridging raw data, language model output, and business action.
